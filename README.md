# Sokkai (速解)
## Instructions
Go to the <a href="https://sokkai.jrmsoftworks.com">website</a> and have everyone in your party join the same room. Press the button that says BUZZ or press the spacebar to buzz. You can manually clear it before the time runs out. The settings button displays various options that you can configure.

## What
Sokkai is a free online buzzer system. It is a website so it should work cross-platform without any major compatibility issues (it should work on whatever device you want as long as it has an internet connection and a modern web browser). Nothing fancy...just a regular buzzer system. It tells you who buzzed and has lockout functionality. Yay!

## Who
Sokkai is a cloned/revamped version of QBBuzzer (jonathanluck/qbbuzzer).
The main differences are: visual overhaul, Japanese language support, various fixes. NoSleep was added to prevent devices from disconnecting mid-game. The code has been edited/fixed only as necessary.
